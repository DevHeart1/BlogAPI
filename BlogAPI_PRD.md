# Product Requirements Document: BlogAPI Backend

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 24, 2025
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the product requirements for BlogAPI, a backend system designed to power blog applications. It details the project's goals, target users, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and success metrics. This PRD serves as a guide for the development team to ensure the final product meets the intended objectives.

### 1.2. Project Overview
BlogAPI is a modern, robust, and versatile backend platform providing comprehensive support for both RESTful and GraphQL APIs. It aims to serve as a headless CMS backend, offering functionalities like content management (posts, tags, comments), user management with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), search, pagination, Markdown support, and post versioning.

## 2. Goals

*   To provide a flexible and powerful backend solution for various blog and content-driven applications.
*   To offer developers a choice between RESTful and GraphQL APIs for seamless integration.
*   To implement robust content management features, including CRUD operations for posts, tags, comments, and users.
*   To ensure secure access and operations through a comprehensive RBAC system (admin, editor, user roles).
*   To deliver advanced features such as pagination, full-text search, Markdown parsing, and post versioning.
*   To build a scalable and maintainable system that can adapt to future enhancements.

## 3. Target Audience/Users

*   **Backend Developers:** Integrating BlogAPI into custom frontends or other services.
*   **Frontend Developers:** Building web or mobile applications that consume BlogAPI.
*   **Content Creators/Editors:** (Indirectly) Managing blog content through applications built on top of BlogAPI.
*   **System Administrators:** Deploying, managing, and maintaining the BlogAPI instance.

## 4. Assumptions and Constraints

*   This project is **backend-only**. No frontend UI components are within the scope of this PRD.
*   The primary interfaces will be a REST API and a GraphQL API.
*   Specific technologies for implementation (e.g., programming language, framework, database) will be chosen based on suitability for the requirements, but the documentation mentions placeholders like Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL/MongoDB. These will need to be finalized.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Core Features

*   **Dual API Support:**
    *   Provide a comprehensive RESTful API.
    *   Provide a comprehensive GraphQL API.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
    *   Define at least three user roles: `admin`, `editor`, `user`.
    *   `admin`: Full access to all system functionalities, including user management and system configuration.
    *   `editor`: Can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) posts, tags, and comments. Cannot manage users or system settings.
    *   `user`: Can read published posts and comments. Can create comments (subject to moderation if implemented). Can manage their own profile.
*   **Content Management (CRUD Operations):**
    *   **Posts:**
        *   Create, Read, Update, Delete posts.
        *   Support for post states (e.g., draft, published, archived).
        *   Associate posts with authors (Users) and Tags.
        *   Unique slugs for posts.
    *   **Tags:**
        *   Create, Read, Update, Delete tags.
        *   Associate tags with multiple posts.
        *   Unique slugs for tags.
    *   **Comments:**
        *   Create, Read, Update, Delete comments (permissions based on RBAC and ownership).
        *   Associate comments with posts and users.
        *   (Optional: Support for threaded comments and moderation).
    *   **Users:**
        *   Create, Read, Update, Delete users (admin only for delete/update of others).

        *   Assign roles to users.
*   **Advanced Functionality:**
    *   **Pagination:** Implement pagination for API endpoints that return lists of resources (e.g., posts, tags, comments, users).
    *   **Search:** Provide search functionality across posts (title, content) and potentially tags.
    *   **Markdown Parsing:** Store post content in Markdown format and provide an option to retrieve it as parsed HTML (or expect clients to parse).
    *   **Post Versioning:** Track changes to posts, allowing retrieval of previous versions and potentially rollback to a specific version.

### 5.2. API Specifications

*   **Authentication:**
    *   Implement a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT-based).
    *   Provide endpoints for user login (token generation) and potentially registration (if self-registration is allowed).
    *   Authenticated requests must include a valid token.
*   **REST API:**
    *   Follow RESTful design principles (stateless, standard HTTP methods, resource-based URLs).
    *   Provide clear and consistent URL structures for all resources.
    *   Use standard HTTP status codes for responses.
    *   Support content negotiation (e.g., `application/json`).
    *   **Endpoints (examples from `BlogAPIDoc.md`):**
        *   Users: `GET /users`, `POST /users`, `GET /users/{id}`, `PUT /users/{id}`, `DELETE /users/{id}`, `GET /users/me`
        *   Posts: `GET /posts`, `POST /posts`, `GET /posts/{id_or_slug}`, `PUT /posts/{id_or_slug}`, `DELETE /posts/{id_or_slug}`, `GET /posts/{id_or_slug}/versions`, `POST /posts/{id_or_slug}/versions/{version_id}/revert`
        *   Tags: `GET /tags`, `POST /tags`, `GET /tags/{id_or_slug}`, `PUT /tags/{id_or_slug}`, `DELETE /tags/{id_or_slug}`

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1. Performance
*   APIs should respond within acceptable timeframes (e.g., <500ms for typical requests under normal load).
*   The system should be able to handle a reasonable number of concurrent users/requests (specific targets to be defined based on expected load).
*   Database queries should be optimized to prevent bottlenecks.

### 6.2. Scalability
*   The architecture should allow for horizontal scaling of the application servers.
*   The database choice should support scaling to accommodate data growth and increased load.

### 6.3. Security
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization (RBAC).
*   Protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS - though XSS is more client-side, API should not return unsanitized data that could lead to it).
*   Securely store sensitive data (e.g., hashed passwords).
*   Use HTTPS for all API communication.
*   Implement input validation for all API endpoints.

### 6.4. Reliability/Availability
*   The API should aim for high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime).
*   Implement proper error handling and logging to facilitate troubleshooting.

### 6.5. Maintainability
*   Code should be well-structured, documented, and follow consistent coding standards.
*   The system should be designed in a modular way to facilitate updates and new feature development.
*   Comprehensive API documentation (like `BlogAPIDoc.md`) must be maintained.

### 6.6. Error Handling
*   APIs must return clear, consistent, and informative error messages.
*   Use standard HTTP status codes for REST API errors.
*   GraphQL API should follow GraphQL error handling conventions.
*   Provide error details or codes that can be used by client applications for diagnostics or user feedback.

### 6.7. Rate Limiting
*   Implement rate limiting on API requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage (configurable limits per IP or per authenticated user).

### 6.8. Logging
*   Implement comprehensive logging for requests, errors, and significant system events to aid in debugging and monitoring.

## 7. API Design Principles

*   **Consistency:** API design should be consistent across REST and GraphQL interfaces where applicable.
*   **Clarity:** Endpoints, field names, and documentation should be clear and easy to understand.
*   **Simplicity:** Favor simple and intuitive API designs.
*   **Statelessness:** REST API calls should be stateless.
*   **Security by Design:** Security considerations should be integral to the API design process.

## 8. Future Considerations / Out of Scope (for v1.0)

*   Advanced image/media handling and storage (beyond simple URL references).
*   Webhooks for event-driven integrations.
*   GraphQL Subscriptions (if not included in v1.0).
*   Advanced comment moderation workflows.
*   Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n).
*   Full-fledged analytics.

## 9. Success Metrics

*   **API Adoption:** Number of client applications or services successfully integrating with BlogAPI.
*   **Performance Benchmarks:** API response times meet defined targets.
*   **System Stability:** High uptime and low error rates.
*   **Developer Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from developers using the API (measured via surveys or community feedback).
*   **Feature Completeness:** All functional requirements outlined in this PRD are implemented and working correctly.
*   **Security:** No critical security vulnerabilities identified post-launch.

## 10. Documentation Requirements

*   Comprehensive API reference documentation (as initiated with `BlogAPIDoc.md`), including authentication, endpoints, request/response formats, and examples for both REST and GraphQL.
*   Getting Started guide for developers.
*   Deployment and configuration guide.
