*   **Maintainability:** Prefer technologies with strong community support, good documentation, and established best practices.
*   **Developer Productivity:** Tools and frameworks that enhance developer workflow and speed up development.
*   **Security:** Prioritize technologies with built-in security features and a good track record.
*   **Ecosystem & Integration:** Consider how well the technologies integrate with each other and with potential third-party services.
*   **Alignment with PRD:** Ensure the stack can deliver all functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., REST & GraphQL support, RBAC, Post Versioning).

## 3. Core Backend Technologies

### 3.1. Programming Language

*   **Decision:** Node.js (with TypeScript)
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Node.js is excellent for I/O-bound applications like a BlogAPI, due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
    *   It has a vast ecosystem (npm) providing a rich set of libraries for various functionalities.
    *   TypeScript enhances JavaScript with static typing, improving code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity, which is crucial for a project of this scale.
    *   Strong support for both REST and GraphQL API development.

### 3.2. Backend Framework

*   **Decision:** Express.js (Node.js)
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
    *   It is widely adopted, with a large community and abundant middleware for various tasks (routing, error handling, security).
    *   Integrates seamlessly with Apollo Server for GraphQL and other necessary libraries.
    *   Its unopinionated nature allows for structuring the application according to project needs.

### 3.3. Database

*   **Type:** Relational (SQL)
*   **Decision (SQL):** PostgreSQL
    *   **Rationale:** PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, feature robustness (ACID compliance, complex queries, JSONB support), and data integrity. It's well-suited for structured data with relationships as expected in BlogAPI (users, posts, tags, comments).
*   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):**
    *   **Decision:** TypeORM
    *   **Rationale:** TypeORM is a mature ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript, supporting both Data Mapper and ActiveRecord patterns. It integrates seamlessly with Node.js (and Express.js) and PostgreSQL, allowing developers to work with databases using TypeScript classes and decorators. It supports migrations, transactions, and a wide range of database features.

## 4. API Design & Implementation

### 4.1. REST API

*   **Specification:** OpenAPI 3.x will be used for defining and documenting the RESTful API.
*   **Implementation:** Implemented using Express.js routing and controllers.
*   **Tools:** Swagger Editor/UI (or similar tools like Postman) for documentation generation and testing.

### 4.2. GraphQL API

*   **Decision (Core Library):** Apollo Server
    *   **Rationale:** Apollo Server is a widely-adopted, feature-rich GraphQL server for Node.js. It integrates seamlessly with Express.js as middleware. It supports subscriptions, caching, and has excellent tooling (Apollo Studio, GraphQL Playground), aligning with the project's need for a flexible data query language.
*   **Schema Definition Language (SDL):** Standard GraphQL SDL will be used.
*   **Tools:** GraphQL Playground or GraphiQL for schema exploration and testing (often bundled with Apollo Server).

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

*   **Mechanism:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
    *   **Rationale:** JWTs are a standard, stateless, and secure method for API authentication, suitable for modern web and mobile applications.
*   **Libraries:**
    *   **JWT Handling:** `jsonwebtoken` (Node.js)
        *   **Rationale:** A popular, lightweight, and well-maintained library for signing and verifying JWTs in Node.js.
    *   **Password Hashing:** `bcrypt`
        *   **Rationale:** `bcrypt` is a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm specifically designed for passwords, providing protection against brute-force attacks.
*   **RBAC Implementation:** Custom logic within the application (e.g., Express.js middleware) mapping roles to permissions.
    *   **Rationale:** Provides fine-grained control over access to different API resources and operations based on user roles.

## 6. Key Functionality Support

*   **Markdown Parsing:**
    *   **Decision (Library):** `markdown-it`
    *   **Rationale:** `markdown-it` is a fast, extensible, and CommonMark compliant Markdown parser for JavaScript. Its plugin architecture allows for customization if needed.
*   **Search:**
    *   **Initial:** Database-specific search capabilities (e.g., `LIKE` queries, Full-Text Search in PostgreSQL).
    *   **Advanced (Future):** Dedicated search engine like Elasticsearch or Algolia if needed for more complex search requirements.
*   **Pagination:** Implemented via API parameters (e.g., `limit`/`offset` or `page`/`pageSize`).
*   **Post Versioning:** Custom logic to store and retrieve different versions of posts, likely in a separate table linked to posts.

## 7. Development & Operations (DevOps)

### 7.1. Version Control

*   **System:** Git
*   **Hosting:** GitHub
    *   **Rationale:** GitHub provides excellent collaboration features, issue tracking, and integrates well with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions.

### 7.2. Containerization (Recommended)

*   **Technology:** Docker
*   **Orchestration (Optional, for larger deployments):** Kubernetes, Docker Swarm
*   **Rationale:** Consistent development and deployment environments, simplifies dependency management, and facilitates scalability.

### 7.3. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)

*   **Decision (Tools):** GitHub Actions
    *   **Rationale:** GitHub Actions offers a convenient way to automate software workflows directly within the GitHub repository. It's easy to set up for CI/CD pipelines, including linting, testing, building, and deploying applications.
*   **Pipeline Stages:** Linting, testing (unit, integration), building, containerizing, deploying.

### 7.4. Testing

*   **Decision (Unit/Integration Testing Framework):** Jest
    *   **Rationale:** Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript/TypeScript, particularly within the Node.js ecosystem. It offers a simple API, built-in mocking capabilities, code coverage reports, and parallel test execution.
*   **API Testing Tools:** Postman, Newman, or custom scripts.

### 7.5. Logging

*   **Format:** Structured logging (JSON) for easier parsing by log management systems.

### 7.6. Monitoring & Alerting (Future Consideration)

*   **Tools (Optional):** Prometheus & Grafana, Datadog, New Relic.
*   **Metrics:** API response times, error rates, system resource usage.

## 8. Environment Configuration

*   **Method:** Environment variables.
    *   **Rationale:** Using environment variables is a standard practice for managing application configuration, ensuring that sensitive information is not hardcoded.
*   **Libraries:** `dotenv` (for local development)
    *   **Rationale:** `dotenv` loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, simplifying local development configuration.

## 9. Security Considerations

*   **Input Validation:** `class-validator` (or similar libraries compatible with Express.js and TypeScript, like Joi).
    *   **Rationale:** Essential for validating request payloads (DTOs) to ensure data integrity and prevent common vulnerabilities. `class-validator` works well with TypeScript classes.
*   **HTTPS:** Enforced for all API communication in production (typically handled by a reverse proxy or load balancer).
*   **Dependency Management:** Regular scanning for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (e.g., `npm audit`, Snyk).
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implemented at the API gateway level or within the application (e.g., using `express-rate-limit`).
