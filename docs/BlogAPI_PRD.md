# BlogAPI - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** May 26, 2025
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for BlogAPI, a backend system designed to power a modern blogging platform. It details the system's purpose, features, user roles, functional, and non-functional requirements.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   Provide a robust and scalable backend for managing blog content (posts, tags, comments).
*   Support multiple user roles with distinct permissions (Admin, Editor, User).
*   Offer flexible content access via both RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
*   Ensure reliable performance and data integrity.
*   Facilitate content versioning and moderation.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Developers:** Building frontend applications (web, mobile) for blogging platforms or headless CMS solutions.
*   **Content Editors:** Creating, managing, and publishing blog content.
*   **Site Administrators:** Managing users, system settings, and overall platform health.

## 4. Assumptions and Dependencies

*   Clients will handle UI/UX and frontend rendering.
*   The system will be deployed in a containerized environment.
*   A PostgreSQL database will be used for data persistence.
*   Initial authentication will be via email/password.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Core Features

#### Content Management - Posts

*   **Create Post:** Editors and Admins can create new blog posts.
    *   **Description:** Allows authorized users to draft and save new blog articles, including title, content in Markdown format, associated tags, and an initial status (e.g., draft, published).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
        *   AC1: An editor or admin can successfully create a new post with a title, `content_markdown`, and status ('draft' or 'published').
        *   AC2: A unique slug is automatically generated for the new post based on the title upon creation if not provided by the user.
        *   AC3: The post is correctly associated with the author (the authenticated editor/admin who created it).
        *   AC4: If tags are provided, they are associated with the post (new tags may be created if they don't exist).
*   **Read Post(s):** Users can retrieve individual posts or lists of posts.
    *   **Description:** Provides endpoints for fetching published posts (publicly accessible) and drafts/archived posts (for authorized users). Supports filtering, sorting, and pagination.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
        *   AC1: Any user (authenticated or anonymous) can retrieve a list of 'published' posts, with pagination.
        *   AC2: Any user (authenticated or anonymous) can retrieve a single 'published' post by its ID or slug.
        *   AC3: An editor or admin can retrieve posts with 'draft' or 'archived' status. An author can retrieve their own 'draft' posts.
        *   AC4: Unauthorized users cannot retrieve 'draft' or 'archived' posts they do not own.
*   **Update Post:** Editors and Admins can modify existing posts.
    *   **Description:** Allows authorized users to change the title, content, tags, status, or other attributes of an existing post. Post versioning should be triggered for significant content changes.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
        *   AC1: An editor or admin can successfully update the title, `content_markdown`, status, or tags of an existing post.
        *   AC2: If an editor (not the original author) or an admin updates a post, the original author information remains unchanged.
        *   AC3: Updating a post's content creates a new version of the post, and the previous version is preserved.
        *   AC4: An author can update their own posts (both draft and published).
*   **Delete Post:** Editors and Admins can remove posts.
    *   **Description:** Allows authorized users to delete posts. This might be a soft delete (marking as 'archived' or 'deleted') to allow for recovery, or a hard delete.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
        *   AC1: An editor or admin can successfully delete a post (e.g., change its status to 'archived' or 'deleted').
        *   AC2: Once a post is deleted (soft delete), it is no longer visible in public listings.
        *   AC3: An author can delete their own posts. *(Consider if this should be a soft delete by default)*

#### User Management

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

*   **Admin Role:**
    *   **Description:** Has full control over the system, including managing users, all content, and system settings.
    *   **Permissions:** Can perform all CRUD operations on posts, tags, comments, and users. Can change user roles.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
        *   AC1: An admin can successfully change the role of any other user (e.g., from 'user' to 'editor').
        *   AC2: An admin can delete any post or comment on the platform.
        *   AC3: An admin can access a list of all registered users.
*   **Editor Role:**
    *   **Description:** Can manage all content on the platform but cannot manage users or system settings.
    *   **Permissions:** Can perform all CRUD operations on posts, tags, and comments. Cannot manage user accounts (except their own profile).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
        *   AC1: An editor can successfully create, publish, update, and delete any post on the platform.
        *   AC2: An editor can manage (create, update, delete) tags and comments.
        *   AC3: An editor cannot change another user's role or delete another user's account.
*   **User Role (Authenticated User):**
    *   **Description:** Basic authenticated user. Can manage their own profile and interact with content (e.g., comment).
    *   **Permissions:** Can read published posts, create comments, manage their own profile. Cannot create posts or tags.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
        *   AC1: A user can successfully view any 'published' post.
        *   AC2: A user cannot create a new post or tag (attempting to do so via API results in a 'Forbidden' error).
        *   AC3: A user can add a comment to any 'published' post.
        *   AC4: A user can update their own profile information (e.g., bio, username, password).

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1. Performance

*   **Response Times:**
    *   P95 (95th percentile) latency for key read operations (e.g., `GET /api/v1/posts`, `GET /api/v1/posts/{id_or_slug}`, equivalent GraphQL queries) should be < 500ms under a defined standard load of X concurrent users.
    *   P95 latency for key write operations (e.g., `POST /api/v1/posts`, `POST /api/v1/posts/{postId}/comments`, equivalent GraphQL mutations) should be < 800ms under a defined standard load of Y concurrent users.
    *   *(Note: Specific values for X and Y concurrent users, and the definition of "standard load," need to be established based on expected usage and refined post-benchmarking.)*
*   **Concurrent Connections:** The system should support at least Z active connections simultaneously without significant performance degradation. *(Note: Z needs to be defined based on expected peak load and refined post-benchmarking.)*
*   **Database Performance:** Database queries should be optimized to ensure efficient data retrieval and updates. Indexing strategies will be implemented for frequently queried fields.

### 6.2. Scalability
*(Placeholder)*

### 6.3. Reliability & Availability
*(Placeholder)*

### 6.4. Security

### 6.5. Maintainability

### 6.6. Usability (for API consumers)

## 7. API Specifications

*   The system will expose both RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
*   Detailed API documentation will be provided (refer to `BlogAPIDoc.md`).
