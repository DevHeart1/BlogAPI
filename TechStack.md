# Tech Stack Document: BlogAPI Backend

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 24, 2025
**Status:** Proposed

## 1. Introduction

This document details the proposed technology stack for the BlogAPI backend project. The choices outlined here are based on the requirements specified in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and aim to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable system.

As BlogAPI is a backend-only project, this document focuses exclusively on server-side technologies, databases, APIs, and related development and deployment tools.

## 2. Guiding Principles for Technology Selection

*   **Scalability:** Technologies should support horizontal and vertical scaling to handle growing data and user load.
*   **Performance:** Chosen stack should enable efficient request processing and low latency.
*   **Maintainability:** Prefer technologies with strong community support, good documentation, and established best practices.
*   **Developer Productivity:** Tools and frameworks that enhance developer workflow and speed up development.
*   **Security:** Prioritize technologies with built-in security features and a good track record.
*   **Ecosystem & Integration:** Consider how well the technologies integrate with each other and with potential third-party services.
*   **Alignment with PRD:** Ensure the stack can deliver all functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., REST & GraphQL support, RBAC, Post Versioning).

## 3. Core Backend Technologies

### 3.1. Programming Language

*   **Proposed:** [Specify Language, e.g., Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript), Python, Go, Java, Ruby]
*   **Considerations & Rationale:**
    *   **Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript):** Excellent for I/O-bound applications, large ecosystem (npm), good support for both REST and GraphQL (e.g., with Express.js/NestJS and Apollo Server). TypeScript adds static typing for better maintainability.
    *   **Python:** Strong for rapid development, mature frameworks (Django, Flask), good for data handling. Libraries like Graphene for GraphQL.
    *   **Go:** High performance, excellent concurrency support, statically typed. Good for building microservices.
    *   **Java:** Robust, mature ecosystem, strong for enterprise-level applications. Frameworks like Spring Boot.
    *   **Ruby:** Developer-friendly, convention-over-configuration (Ruby on Rails).
*   **Decision:** *(To be finalized after further evaluation or based on team expertise)*

### 3.2. Backend Framework

*   **Proposed:** [Based on Language Choice, e.g., Express.js/NestJS (Node.js), Django/Flask (Python), Gin (Go), Spring Boot (Java), Ruby on Rails (Ruby)]
*   **Considerations & Rationale:**
    *   The framework should provide robust routing, middleware support, and an easy way to structure the application.
    *   It should have good support for building RESTful APIs and integrating GraphQL libraries.
*   **Decision:** *(To be finalized)*

### 3.3. Database

*   **Type:** Relational (SQL) or NoSQL
*   **Proposed SQL:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL]
    *   **Rationale:** Strong consistency, ACID properties, mature, good for structured data and complex relationships (users, posts, tags, comments, versions).
*   **Proposed NoSQL:** [e.g., MongoDB (Document), Cassandra (Columnar)]
    *   **Rationale:** Flexibility, scalability, good for unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB is often paired with Node.js applications.
*   **ORM/ODM (Object-Relational/Document Mapper):**
    *   **Proposed:** [e.g., Sequelize/TypeORM/Prisma (Node.js), SQLAlchemy (Python), GORM (Go), Hibernate (Java), ActiveRecord (Ruby)]
    *   **Rationale:** Simplifies database interactions, provides an abstraction layer, helps prevent SQL injection.
*   **Decision:** *(To be finalized based on data structure complexity, scalability needs, and team familiarity)*

## 4. API Design & Implementation

### 4.1. REST API

*   **Specification:** OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) version 3.x.
*   **Implementation:** Using chosen backend framework's capabilities.
*   **Tools:** Swagger Editor/UI for documentation and testing.

### 4.2. GraphQL API

*   **Core Library:** [e.g., Apollo Server (Node.js), Graphene (Python), graphql-go (Go), GraphQL Java (Java)]
*   **Schema Definition Language (SDL):** Standard GraphQL SDL will be used.
*   **Tools:** GraphQL Playground or GraphiQL for schema exploration and testing.

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

*   **Mechanism:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
*   **Libraries:** [e.g., `jsonwebtoken` (Node.js), `PyJWT` (Python)]
*   **Password Hashing:** bcrypt or Argon2.
*   **RBAC Implementation:** Custom logic within the application, mapping roles to permissions.

## 6. Key Functionality Support

*   **Markdown Parsing:**
    *   **Library:** [e.g., `marked` or `markdown-it` (JavaScript), `Mistune` or `Python-Markdown` (Python)]
*   **Search:**
    *   **Initial:** Database-specific search capabilities (e.g., `LIKE` queries, Full-Text Search in PostgreSQL).
    *   **Advanced (Future):** Dedicated search engine like Elasticsearch or Algolia if needed.
*   **Pagination:** Implemented via API parameters (e.g., `limit`/`offset` or `page`/`pageSize`).
*   **Post Versioning:** Custom logic to store and retrieve different versions of posts, likely in a separate table linked to posts.

## 7. Development & Operations (DevOps)

### 7.1. Version Control

*   **System:** Git
*   **Hosting:** [e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket]

### 7.2. Containerization (Recommended)

*   **Technology:** Docker
*   **Orchestration (Optional, for larger deployments):** Kubernetes, Docker Swarm
*   **Rationale:** Consistent development and deployment environments, simplifies dependency management.

### 7.3. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)

*   **Tools:** [e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins]
*   **Pipeline Stages:** Linting, testing (unit, integration), building, deploying.

### 7.4. Testing

*   **Unit Testing Framework:** [e.g., Jest/Mocha (Node.js), PyTest/unittest (Python)]
*   **Integration Testing:** Using testing framework with live or mocked dependencies.
*   **API Testing Tools:** Postman, Newman, or custom scripts.

### 7.5. Logging

*   **Library:** [e.g., Winston/Pino (Node.js), standard `logging` module (Python)]
*   **Format:** Structured logging (e.g., JSON) for easier parsing by log management systems.
*   **Log Management (Optional):** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Grafana Loki, Datadog.

### 7.6. Monitoring & Alerting

*   **Tools (Optional):** Prometheus & Grafana, Datadog, New Relic.
*   **Metrics:** API response times, error rates, system resource usage.

## 8. Environment Configuration

*   **Method:** Environment variables (e.g., using `.env` files for local development, platform-provided environment variables in production).
*   **Libraries:** [e.g., `dotenv` (Node.js)]

## 9. Security Considerations

*   **Input Validation:** Libraries for validating request payloads (e.g., `Joi`, `class-validator` for Node.js).
*   **HTTPS:** Enforced for all API communication (handled by reverse proxy or load balancer in production).
*   **Dependency Management:** Regular scanning for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (e.g., `npm audit`, Snyk).
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implemented at the API gateway level or within the application using libraries like `express-rate-limit` (Node.js).
