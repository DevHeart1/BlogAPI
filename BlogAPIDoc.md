## Introduction

BlogAPI is a robust and modern backend platform designed for powering blog applications. It offers comprehensive support for both RESTful and GraphQL APIs, making it a versatile choice for various frontend implementations.

## Key Features

*   **Dual API Support:** Seamlessly integrate with your preferred API style, whether it's REST or GraphQL.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Pre-defined roles (admin, editor, user) for managing permissions and access to different functionalities.
*   **Comprehensive CRUD Operations:** Full support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for:
    *   Posts (including drafts and published states)
    *   Tags (with support for categories or hierarchies if applicable)
    *   Comments (with threading and moderation capabilities)
    *   Users (with profile management)
*   **Advanced Functionality:**
    *   **Pagination:** Efficiently manage and navigate through large sets of data.
    *   **Search:** Powerful search capabilities to find posts, tags, or users.
    *   **Markdown Parsing:** Built-in support for parsing Markdown content for posts, allowing for rich text formatting.
    *   **Post Versioning:** Keep track of changes to posts with a version history and rollback capabilities.
    *   **Image/Media Handling:** (If applicable, describe how media is managed)
    *   **Webhooks:** (If applicable, for event-driven integrations)

## Technologies Used

*(This section should list the primary technologies, frameworks, and databases used in BlogAPI. E.g., Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, etc.)*

*   **Backend Framework:** [Specify Framework, e.g., Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails]
*   **Database:** [Specify Database, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB]
*   **API Specification:** OpenAPI (for REST), GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)
*   **Authentication:** [Specify Method, e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0]
*   **Programming Language:** [Specify Language, e.g., JavaScript, Python, Ruby]
*   **(Other relevant technologies)**

## Use Cases

BlogAPI is an ideal solution for:

*   **Headless Blog Setups:** Use BlogAPI as the backend for your custom-built frontend or static site generator.
*   **Custom Content Management Systems (CMS):** Build tailored CMS solutions on top of BlogAPI's flexible and powerful backend.

## Getting Started

This section provides instructions on how to get the BlogAPI up and running on your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

*(List any software or tools developers need to have installed before they can set up BlogAPI. E.g., Node.js version, Docker, specific database client.)*

*   [Prerequisite 1, e.g., Node.js >= 18.x]
*   [Prerequisite 2, e.g., npm >= 9.x or yarn >= 1.22.x]
*   [Prerequisite 3, e.g., Docker (if used for local development)]
*   [Prerequisite 4, e.g., A running instance of [Database Name]]

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd BlogAPI
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Or using yarn
    yarn install
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Environment Variables:**
    BlogAPI uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env.example` file (if one exists).
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Update the `.env` file with your specific settings:
    *   `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for your database.
    *   `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for signing JWT tokens.
    *   `API_PORT`: The port on which the API server will run (e.g., 3000).
    *   `GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT`: The path for the GraphQL endpoint (e.g., /graphql).
    *   `(Other necessary variables)`

2.  **Database Setup:**
    *(Provide instructions for database migrations, seeding initial data, etc.)*
    ```bash
    # Example: Run database migrations
    npm run migrate

    # Example: Seed initial data
    npm run seed
    ```

### Running the API

*   **Development Mode:**
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run dev

    # Or using yarn
    yarn dev
    ```
    This will typically start the server with hot-reloading. The API should be accessible at `http://localhost:[API_PORT]`.

*   **Production Mode:**
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run build
    npm start

    # Or using yarn
    yarn build
    yarn start
    ```

## API Reference

*(Detailed documentation for REST and GraphQL endpoints would be provided here.)*

### Authentication

*(Describe the authentication mechanism, how to obtain tokens, and how to use them in API requests. E.g., Bearer Token in Authorization header.)*

**Example Request:**
```http
POST /auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

**Example Response:**
```json

**Example Query:**
```graphql
query {
  allPosts(first: 10, skip: 0) {
    id

{
  "errors": [
    {

    }
  ]
